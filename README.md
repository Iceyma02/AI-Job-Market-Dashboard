## 🧠 AI Job Market Dashboard

### 📌 Overview

The **AI Job Market Dashboard** is a data-driven project that explores how **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is reshaping global employment trends. It analyzes job growth, automation risks, and skill demand across multiple industries such as **Technology, Finance, Healthcare, Education, and Manufacturing**.

This project provides insights into how AI is **creating**, **transforming**, and **disrupting** jobs worldwide — using data visualization and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to reveal patterns and trends from real-world datasets.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Analyze the **impact of AI on global and industry-specific job trends**
* Identify **skills in demand** in the AI era
* Visualize **job creation vs automation displacement rates**
* Perform **text analysis** on job listings using NLP to uncover keyword trends
* Build an **interactive dashboard** for exploration and storytelling
